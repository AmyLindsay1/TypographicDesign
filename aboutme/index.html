<h2>Who am i?</h2>
<p> 
  I am a 20-year-old student who studies journalism, Media and Publishing at Oxford Brookes University. I aspire to be involved in fashion journalism, working with brands like Vougue abd Elle magazine, attending fashion shows...especially Paris Fashion Week. i grew up in Bournemouth, which is known for it's beautiful beaches all along the south coast, which is perfect in summer when the weather is nice! Although i love living in Bournemouth, living in Oxford for university is equally as amazing, i live near a canal which is great for long walks!
  In my spare time i enjoy going to the gym, it is a massive part of my daily routine and it is something i am extremely passionate about. Going to the gym is not only good for my health but it gives me a few hours to myslef, in my own headspace to reflect on my day. if i am feeling stressed it is a great way for me to take a break and to refresh my mind.

  I love to travel around the world, travelling expands my perspective and knowledge of how others live. Being exposed to new places, people and different cultures allows me to be more open minded and see the beauty of the world for what it is. it's always good to take a break from reality and to reflect on your own life, your achievements, your failures and how you want your future to evolve, travelling allows me to better myself and learn more about myself and what i want from life. i went to Barcelona this summer, it was such a beautiful city, with so much to do and see. i went and saw The Basilica de la Sagrada Familia, which is Guadi's unfinished church, it was amazing! The good thing about Barcelona is that there is the perfect mix of beach and city, giving you the best of both worlds.
 As well as travelling i love to spend time with friends and family, in which i have a new addition to my family... a puppy! A 4 month old Dachshund called Milo, he is very cute and extremely well behaved... most of the time. He loves going out for walks along Bournemouth Beach!
