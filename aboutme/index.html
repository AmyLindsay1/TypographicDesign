<p> 
  I am a 20-year-old student who studies journalism, Media and Publishing at Oxford Brookes University. 
  I aspire to be involved in fashion journalism, working with brands like Vougue abd Elle magazine, attending 
  fashion shows...especially Paris Fashion Week. i grew up in Bournemouth, which is known for it's beautiful 
  beaches all along the south coast, which is perfect in summer when the weather is nice! Although i love living 
  in Bournemouth, living in Oxford for university is equally as amazing, i live near a canal which is great for long walks!
  In my spare time i enjoy going to the gym, it is a massive part of my daily routine and it is something i am extremely 
  passionate about. Going to the gym is not only good for my health but it gives me a few hours to myslef, in my own headspace 
  to reflect on my day. if i am feeling stressed it is a great way for me to take a break and to refresh my mind. As well as the
   gym i enjoy maintainig a healthy lifestyle, including eating well and practicing mindfulness as i feel it is 
  important to look after your body from the inside out.

  I love to travel around the world, travelling expands my perspective and knowledge of how others live. 
  Being exposed to new places, people and different cultures allows me to be more open minded and see the
   beauty of the world for what it is. it's always good to take a break from reality and to reflect on your 
   own life, your achievements, your failures and how you want your future to evolve, travelling allows me 
   to better myself and learn more about myself and what i want from life. i went to Barcelona this summer, 
   it was such a beautiful city, with so much to do and see. i went and saw The Basilica de la Sagrada Familia, 
   which is Guadi's unfinished church, it was amazing! The good thing about Barcelona is that there is the perfect
    mix of beach and city, giving you the best of both worlds.
 As well as travelling i love to spend time with friends and family, in which i have a new addition to my 
 family... a puppy! A 4 month old Dachshund called Milo, he is very cute and extremely well behaved... most 
 of the time. He loves going out for walks along Bournemouth Beach!

<p> I have a passion for netball, I have played since I was 9 years old in Primary School and it has stayed 
  with me as I have grown up. I previously played for Bournemouth Netball Club all through Secondary school where
   I would train weekly and played competitively against other netball teams. Not only did I enjoy the sport
    itself, but it introduced me to new people and form new friendships, friendships which are still intact today. 
    It allowed me to learn how to communicate and work in a team from a young age, which helped me further in my 
    education, relationships and so on. I also am trained in netball umpiring, at 16 I went on a course which taught 
    me all the umpiring rules in netball and I was able to umpire a few competitive matches myself, which was quite 
    pressurisingâ€¦but it meant I could develop new skills and experiences

  As well as netball, I used to take part in athletics events, where I would compete in 400m and 800m races during 
  the summer. This came hand in hand with netball as the athletics allowed me to increase my fitness and endurance.
