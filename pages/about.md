This Blog is all about typeface in fashion… whether it is Highstreet, Designer or Online. The type of a brand can influence customers in many ways, in all different industries, it is used it fashion to intrigue customers into purchasing from their stores. The bolder the better in other words…

I chose to create this blog and dedicate it to the world of fashion because typography historically used to be used simply for the function of reading and books, however over time and especially in modern day, this has evolved. The function of typography has shifted for the better, it shows emotions, personality, and character. I think it is amazing that brands can use typeface in their favour, it can really say a lot about what the brands style and vibe is, the customer can tell which stores suit them, without even looking at the clothes.

Typography is an explicit and strong method of communication. Fashion Design, just like Typography, has got many design combinations and attributes that must be considered when producing clothes. A designer should know what emotion to associate with the clothing, and what elements are going to help in communicating this emotion. Consumers choose their clothing based on what feeling they are sensing from the garment, and what information they want to transmit to the public.
